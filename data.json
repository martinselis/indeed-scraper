The policies are deployed to our decision engine, which combines the policy logic with external data sources (e.g. REST and database calls) to make access control decisions.\n\nThe Role:\nWe are looking for developers of all experience levels to join our development team in our central Edinburgh office. Most of the current team specialise in frontend or backend development, but we encourage a collaborative approach and welcome applications from specialists and generalists.\n\nAs part of the development team:\n\nYou will contribute to the design, development and testing of Symphonic\u2019s suite of authorization products to meet the needs of existing and future customers.\nYou will help to write and maintain our development, build and deployment tooling.\nYou will help us ensure that the software we develop fits well into diverse customer environments. An interest in dev-ops would be beneficial.\nIf you are interested, there are opportunities for you to work on-site with our customers, doing requirements gathering, solution engineering, and implementation.\n\nWe also collaborate on academic research into formal policy modelling and analysis. If you wish, there is plenty of scope for learning more about this from leading authorities. We also encourage applications from people interested in or with a background in logic or logic programming.\n\nHow We Approach Development:\nWe currently have a development team of 12 people, which we expect to double in size over the next year. Our approach is collaborative, rather than hierarchical - we take shared ownership over all our development processes and activities. Everybody\u2019s opinion is respected and considered, and the diverse range of strengths, skills and experience within the team helps us to write great software, and learn from each other while doing so.\n\nOur processes are agile, evolving when necessary to meet the changing needs of the team and company. The team meets regularly to discuss process, tooling, environment, etc., in the spirit of continual improvement.\n\nTechnical Challenges:\nOur Policy Manager application aims to allow business users to define and test complex access control policies in an intuitive way. To assist with building policies we are also developing state of the art tools that enable testing and analysis of the impact of policies as users write them. Development of this requires us to understand how we should present complicated information to users and how they need to interact with it. Our UI is written in Angular using Typescript, while the backend is a REST API written in Java and Kotlin using the DropWizard framework.\n\nThe challenge in developing our Decision Engine is that it must be correct, secure, scalable and robust. We achieve this by keeping the code as simple and stateless as possible and use concepts from functional programming to separate the definition and execution of policies. We write the decision engine in a mixture of Java and Kotlin.\n\nEnsuring that all the components in our product suite interact as designed is another area of focus. We have created an extensive test suite written in Python (using the pytest framework), which allows us to easily spin up sets of containers to simulate external services in both normal and failure states. This work was recently presented at EuroPython.\n\nWhat You Can Expect From Us:\nGenerous compensation.\n30 days paid holiday per year (pro rata based on 35 hour work week).\nThe chance for you to develop and build ground breaking technology.\nAn informal, fun, and exciting working environment.\nThe opportunity to craft your own role as our company grows.\nA flexible approach to working hours - you can set a work schedule that fits your life.

Thinking back over my own career as a developer, I know that good companies are seriously rare. These are the things that mattered to me:\nIs the working going to be valuable? Am I going to have autonomy? What about direction - am I going to come to work knowing what I need to do and leave feeling like I\u2019ve achieved something? Am I going to be working so hard that I don't have time for a real life? Is there a ridiculous mountain of technical debt in the codebase - will I be given time to tackle it? Is quality really a priority? Am I actually going to be in a team or will I just work on my own thing every day? Am I genuinely going to be given the opportunity to grow? Will I be listened to?

We need to keep the team's experience balanced. This could mean one exceptionally experienced engineer who's right at the top of the their game and one fresh graduate.

Overall, 95 % of our research is classed as world leading or internationally excellent and the EaStCHEM research School has grown to over 80 academics (99% of which were submitted to REF), a testament to both the breadth and strength of our research. More specifically, 100 % of our research environment, which includes factors such as our facilities, grant income, and awards and prizes, is rated as 4* or 3*, and more than 95 % of our research papers submitted for the exercise have been rated as 4* or 3*.\n\nChemistry at the University of Edinburgh has over \u00a334M of current research grants, and has an international research reputation with many of our staff holding prestigious national and international awards. This world-class centre for chemistry has four research groupings: the Chemistry/Biology Interface; Experimental and Theoretical Chemical Physics; Molecular Synthetic Chemistry; and Materials Chemistry. Many academics are involved in more than one research area, and this breadth of activity is exemplified by our research collaborations with our EaStCHEM partner across a variety of disciplines.\n\nWe have world class facilities across the breadth of Chemistry with ready access for all researchers. The provision of an excellent equipment base and service infrastructure underpins all of the research within EaStCHEM, and our core strategy is to ensure the complementarity and synergy between the EaStCHEM partners. Each has a suite of analytical equipment that can be regarded as essential infrastructure for every top-class Chemistry Research School and dedicated scientific support. These facilities include recently refurbished laboratories, a full suite of high- and low-field NMR instrumentation, mass spectrometry, single crystal and powder X-ray crystallography, magnetometry, EPR spectroscopy, surface science, thermal analysis and porosimetry, optical spectroscopy, high pressure facilities, fermentation suite, DNA synthesis, protein purification and biophysical facilities, and the EaStCHEM Research Computing Facility. These are coupled with specialised units where cutting-edge characterisation work is led by world-leading scientists. We also work with developers of national facilities in the UK (Diamond, RAL), Europe (ESRF, ILL), USA (ALS, APS, Oak Ridge, NIST) and further afield in, for example, Australia (ANSTO) and Japan (Spring-8).\n\n\nWe also have dedicated in-house business development executives that manage a large portfolio of research and consultancy projects involving industrial partners, and who offer a variety of services from analysis, consultancy, collaborative research, KTP and R&D support to Industrial sponsored projects. Our research staff work closely with the BDEs and with the local University Commercialisation Offices to ensure that industrial engagement activities and IP development opportunities are maximised.\n\n\n\nCollege of Science and Engineering (http://www.ed.ac.uk/science-engineering)\n\nThe College of Science and Engineering (CSE) is one of the largest and highest-ranked science and engineering groupings in the UK.
